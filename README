# Predictive Epidemic Load Management System

This project is a  full-stack system designed to enable early detection, forecasting, and resource preparedness during epidemic or pandemic situations such as COVID-19. The platform supports health officials and hospitals in making data-driven decisions using predictive analytics and visualizations.

The system is built with a modular architecture that includes time-series forecasting models, a centralized hospital resource dashboard, and live tracking of health trends across national and district levels.

It can be deployed by health departments, research institutions, or hospitals for preparedness during epidemics outbreaks.

 Tech Stack:

- Frontend: React.js and tailwind css.
- Backend: FastAPI (Python).
- Database: SQLite.
- Machine Learning:  ARIMA for time-series forecasting, Ensemble model (Random Forest,Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting).
- LLama LLM via groq API for AI bot.

 Features:

- Forecasting of infection spikes at national and district levels
-  Hospital-level dashboard for ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen supply, and staff tracking
-  ML-based time-series forecasting (Prophet/ARIMA)
- Overload Prediction & Alerting: Identifies potential overload scenarios by forecasting spikes in cases or resource exhaustion and triggers early warnings by using ML model.
- Hospital Load Management: Provides visibility into bed availability,ICU load, ventilator usage, and staff capacity to support efficient hospital-level decision-making.
- AI powered recommendations and insight on overload situation.
